    "# Introduction\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to create some classes that represent different types of real numbers for which some exact arithmetic can be performed, and then compute continued fractions for these numbers. Floating point arithmetic will not be used anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook was for me to get some practice with OOP in Python by doing some fun calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note on libraries\n",
    "The libraries `math` and `fractions` imported above are not strictly necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only function from the math library that is used below is the `gcd` function, which I could define myself. The function `math.floor` is invoked repeatedly below, but these uses all actually call code from `__floor__` methods in the classes defined in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "I originally defined a `RationalNumber` class in this notebook that would have removed the need for the `Fraction` class to be imported, but I decided to cut it since they were the least interesting class of numbers here. The `Fraction` class or something equivalent is needed so that exact arithmetic with fractions can be performed in several places.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The abstract base class\n",
    "First I define an abstract base class `ExactRealNumber`. This specifies the methods that all concrete subclasses must instantiate, and uses them to construct other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concrete subclasses of exact real numbers are required to support just the following operations, where x is an instance of the subclass and n is an integer:\n",
    "* x+n\n",
    "* x==n\n",
    "* x>n\n",
    "* 1/x\n",
    "\n",
    "From those operations, it will be possible to calculate the continued fraction for any instance of the class."
